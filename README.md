- Inspecting the dataset for any null values.
- Visualising the data for month-wise trends, popular genres, etc.

- Movies by Marvel Studios, Twentieth Century Fox, and Warner Bros. are the top three production houses based on the number of votes received by the movies they have produced.
- For Indian movies, Vijay Sethupathi and Fahadh Faasil can be chosen as lead actors and Tapsee Pannu as lead actress based on the average ratings their movies received.
- In case RVSP plans to make a multilingual movie, they can choose between Star Cinema and Twentieth Century production houses, as they are the top two production houses that have the most number of hits among multilingual movies
